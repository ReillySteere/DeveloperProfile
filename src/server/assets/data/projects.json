    "execution": [
      "Built out effective and extensible builders for important business workflows, while also leveraging new advancements in copilot instructions to better support overall domain coverage and developer onboarding.",
      "Collaborated with other software development teams to further ensure intended software architectural boundaries were being respected and that dangerous non-compliant implementations were deprecated in a safe manner without impact to the end user.",
      "Led implementation of new design patterns that fully captured all payment, purchase and product types for checkout submissions.",
      "Introduced event driven architecture leveraging NestJS, including additional tooling to support intended functionality while still maintaining a request-scope only model - significantly reducing the total experienced time for Checkout Submissions and setting the system up well for future enhancements and workflows.",
      "Introduced architectural fitness functions (Jest/Linting) to ensure intended design patterns were being followed and to prevent regression of critical architectural boundaries.",
      "Introduced ADRs and Logical Component Documentation to better capture architectural decisions and important system components."

    "results": [
      "All issues occurring during the course of this migration, whether introduced by this work or various product initiatives on the same domain were detected through automated means rather than customer reports, significantly improving the user experience and reducing lost-revenue due to avoidable errors.",
      "Built stand-alone microservice to support safe migration / equivalency between systems for workflows managed in different micro-frontends as well as significantly improved integration test tooling and coverage of system.",
      "Improved test coverage of system from 60% to 95%+ through a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, significantly improving developer confidence when making changes to the system and reducing the likelihood of regressions reaching production environments.",
      "Significantly reduced a huge amount of cyclomatic and cognitive complexity by replacing organic development and a multitude of partial design pattern implementations with a fully thought-out and consistent architecture that could be easily reasoned about and extended by engineers of varying experience levels. The new system also clearly optimizes for areas seeing the most frequent changes and has been significantly enhanced through linting, architectural fitness functions and documentation to properly guide growth moving forward."
